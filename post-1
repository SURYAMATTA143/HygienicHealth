<h3>Toilet hygiene</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wash your hands after you use the restroom. Scrub with soap for 20 to 30 seconds, and be sure to clean between your fingers, on the back of your hands, and under your nails. Rinse with warm water, and dry with a clean towel.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you don’t have running water or soap, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer will also work. Use one that’s at least 60 percent alcohol.</p>

<h3>Shower hygiene</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Personal preference may dictate how often you wish to shower, but most people will benefit from a rinse at least every other day. Showering with soap helps rinse away dead skin cells, bacteria, and oils.</p>

<h3>Nail hygiene</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trim your nails regularly to keep them short and clean. Brush under them with a nail brush or washcloth to rinse away buildup, dirt, and germs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Tidying your nails helps you prevent spreading germs into your mouth and other body openings. You should also avoid biting your nails.</p>

<h3>Teeth hygiene</h3>

<p>Good dental hygiene is about more than just pearly white teeth. Caring for your teeth and gums is a smart way to prevent gum diseases and cavities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brush at least twice a day for 2 minutes. Aim to brush after you wake up and before bed. If you can, brush after every meal, too. Floss between your teeth daily, and ask your dentist about using an antibacterial mouthwash.</p>

<p>If you’re not feeling well, you should take steps to keep from spreading germs to others.

Also, immediately throw away any soiled tissues.</p>
