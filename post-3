<h2>Mouth and Teeth</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brushing teeth two times every day is an important part of oral hygiene. Use a toothbrush with soft bristles in a size that fits into all areas of the mouth easily. Flossing between teeth once each day is also important for removing bacteria from between teeth and under gums. Not brushing and flossing teeth regularly can lead to issues with teeth. Bacteria will cover teeth, which leads to plaque and tartar build-up. Over time, cavities will occur and tartar will damage teeth and become hard to remove. Not brushing could also lead to unhealthy gums because the brushing action stimulates gums and keeps them healthy.</p>

<h2>Hand-Washing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hand-washing has a direct correlation with overall health because it eliminates germs that could enter the body by fingers touching the mouth, nose, eyes, and ears. Any time hands become visibly dirty, it’s important to wash them. It’s also necessary to wash hands after blowing your nose or sneezing into your hands, before eating or drinking, after handling raw meat, after touching garbage, after petting or touching animals, and after caring for a sick person. Proper hand-washing involves lathering the hands generously for at least 15 seconds and rinsing them under warm water. Dry hands with a clean towel to finish.</p>

<h2>Head and Hair</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Washing the scalp and the hair regularly can help avoid issues such as folliculitis and seborrheic dermatitis. Over time, hair collects environmental dirt, sweat and oil from the scalp. This accumulation will lead to dirty hair and a dirty scalp. Chemicals contained in shampoo have special formulations for cleaning hair and the scalp to remove oils and dirt. Lack of cleanliness is a myth associated with head lice and dandruff; however, head lice and dandruff are not a result of poor hygiene. Head lice spread from close physical contact. Dandruff is simply flaky skin from the scalp that results from over-productive</p>
